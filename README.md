# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors influencing passenger survival. Insights from the EDA are then used to build a Logistic Regression classification model that preprocesses data, handles missing values, and predicts the outcome, ultimately achieving a predictive accuracy of 80.4%.
